# ci-mask-gate.sh — offline nDPI provenance gate for published mask assets.
# (R2 Phase A — see docs/R2_PHASE_A.md.)
#
# Every mask in assets/masks/*.json defines how aivpn shapes real client uplink
# traffic to look like a target protocol (STUN, QUIC, …). This gate proves that
# claim against a real DPI engine BEFORE a mask can be merged/published: it
# synthesises each mask's actual on-wire packets (via `maskpcap`, the exact
# client build path) and classifies them with nDPI (`ndpiReader -d`, DPI-only,
# no UDP-port guessing). A mask PASSES only if nDPI labels it as its declared
# target protocol and raises no VPN/obfuscation risk flag; otherwise it is a
# REJECT and this script exits non-zero, failing the build.
#
# Hermetic: all paths are resolved relative to the repo root (this file's
# location), never the caller's CWD.
#
# Graceful skip: the DPI toolchain (nDPI source build + the `maskpcap` Rust bin)
# lives under the gitignored research/ tree and is NOT present in a plain clone.
# When it is missing this gate SKIPS with a clear message and exit 0, so a
# developer without the research toolchain is never blocked. CI that wants the
# gate enforced must build the toolchain first (see docs/R2_PHASE_A.md) and can
# set MASK_GATE_REQUIRE=1 to turn a skip into a hard failure.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all masks PASS  — or the toolchain is absent and MASK_GATE_REQUIRE unset
#   1  at least one mask REJECTed by nDPI  (build-failing condition)
#   2  toolchain absent AND MASK_GATE_REQUIRE=1  (enforced-but-unbuildable)
#
# Usage: scripts/ci-mask-gate.sh [mask_dir]   (default: assets/masks)
