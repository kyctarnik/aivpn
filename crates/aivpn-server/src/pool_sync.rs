//! Server pool synchronisation — keeps clients.json in sync across pool nodes.
//!
//! ## Design
//! Pool nodes share a secret `sync_key` (32-byte BLAKE3 key, base64 in server.json)
//! and each node declares a unique `node_id` (the string the OTHER nodes use for
//! it in their `peers` lists).  For every peer link the node derives DIRECTIONAL
//! sub-keys via `crypto::derive_directional_peer_keys`: roles are assigned by
//! lexicographic order of the two ids (smaller id = "client" — sends with the
//! pair's c2s sub-key, receives with s2c; larger id does the opposite), so both
//! ends independently agree on which key encrypts which direction — no
//! handshake.  A *synthetic peer session* is registered in the `SessionManager`
//! per peer, keyed by the RECEIVE sub-key for that link, and outbound packets
//! are encrypted with the SEND sub-key.  This means A→B and B→A never share an
//! AEAD (key, nonce) space even though each node's nonce counter runs
//! independently.  Consequence: pool nodes must list each other MUTUALLY in
//! `peers` — a node only accepts sync from peers it has a link (and therefore a
//! receive session) for.
//!
//! Outbound sync packets are standard-looking VPN UDP datagrams sent to the
//! peer's VPN port. Their framing is FIXED and mask-independent (see
//! [`CLUSTER_MDH_LEN`]): `[8-byte resonance tag][CLUSTER_MDH_LEN random
//! bytes][ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphertext]`. Cluster packets deliberately do NOT
//! follow the node's primary mask layout: the primary mask differs across
//! nodes and over time (rotation), and embedded-tag masks (`tag_offset !=
//! u16::MAX`) move both the tag and the ciphertext offsets — a sender framing
//! with ITS primary mask while the receiver decodes with THEIRS fails AEAD on
//! every packet. The gateway decodes any `is_pool_peer`/`is_site_peer`
//! session with this exact fixed layout.
//!
//! Incoming PoolSync packets are processed by the gateway's normal receive loop
//! and dispatched to `handle_control_message` as `ControlPayload::PoolSync`.
//!
//! ## Replay protection
//! The resonance counter is set to `unix_ms / 5_000` (5-second buckets).
//! Both sender and receiver independently compute the same counter for the same
//! wall-clock window.  The 511-counter tag window covers ±42 minutes of clock
//! drift, making time-based replay attacks impractical.
//!
//! ## Nonce-reuse safety across restarts
//! The pool session key is derived deterministically from the long-lived,
//! operator-configured `sync_key` — it never changes across restarts (unlike a
//! normal client session's key, which is fresh per handshake). The AEAD nonce
//! is built directly from the send counter, and the gateway's generic receive
//! path reconstructs that exact nonce from the counter it recovers via the
//! resonance tag (see `Session::next_send_nonce` / `compute_nonce`) — so, unlike
//! `chain_forwarder.rs`/`site_sync.rs`, the nonce here cannot simply be replaced
//! with a fully random value without breaking peer decryption.
//!
//! Instead, the send counter's high-water mark is persisted to disk
//! (`pool_sync_counter.state`, next to the clients DB) and durably bumped
//! *before* every packet that uses it. On restart the counter resumes at
//! `max(persisted + 1, current_time_bucket)`, so a fast restart landing in the
//! same 5-second wall-clock bucket as a prior run can never reuse a counter
//! value under the same static session key — closing the (key, nonce) reuse
//! window that would otherwise let ChaCha20-Poly1305 keystreams collide.
